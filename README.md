**emojirs_ls** is a file listing tool inspired by the traditional `ls` command. Developed in Rust, it leverages all the efficiency and security of the language to offer exceptionally fast performance. Its design is minimalist, focused only on the essentials, but with a special touch: the clever use of emojis to represent file and directory types, making terminal navigation more visual, intuitive, and fun. It is ideal for users who want something lightweight, fast, and with personality, without sacrificing functionality.
